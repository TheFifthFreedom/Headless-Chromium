# Headless-Chromium
A [CEF3](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef)-based app that's basically a headless version of Chromium meant to be used for automation via [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/). 
I used it as a replacement for [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) as a scraping tool to emulate real-life browser usage and thus avoid flagging.
This is the Mac version, and is meant to be built using XCode - see [here](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/BranchesAndBuilding) for instructions.
